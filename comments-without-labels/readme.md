Create five folders in the current directory, namely 'all', 'file', 'class', 'method', and 'block'.

Run [split](/data_collection/map_remap.py#L144) to extract comments to this directory.

Once the comments are extracted here, note that the comment has the same `loc_idx` belongs to the same code snippet.
