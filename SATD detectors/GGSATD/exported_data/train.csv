fixme formatters are not thread safe,1
xxx jon skeet the comment if it ha not been done already may not be strictly true wrapper maybeconfigure will not configure the same attributestext more than once but it may well add the child again unless i 've missed something,1
i hate to admit it but we do not know what happened here throw the exception,1
just a note starteam ha a status for new which implies that there is an item on your local machine that is not in the repository these are the item that show up a not in view in the starteam gui one would think that we would want to perhaps checkin the new item not in all case ! steve cohen dec unfortunately the sdk doe not really work and we can not actually see anything with a status of new that is why we can just check out everything here without worrying about losing anything,1
the generated class must not be added in the generic jar ! is that buggy on old jonas \? \?,1
todo is this comment still relevant \? \? fixme need to use a saxsource a the source for the transform so we can plug in our own entity resolver,1
this is turned off temporarily there appears to be a bug in selectorutils matchpattern where it is recursive on window even if no is in pattern assertequals ffftffffffff result unix v assertequals ffftfffftfff result window,1
pattern now hold while string is not exhausted this will generate false positive but we can live with that,1
fixme is no namespace is empty namespace really ok \?,1
fixme this is actually not very cpu cycle friendly a we are converting from do to java while the underlying sun implementation will convert from java to do time for internal storage,1
check first that it is not already loaded otherwise consecutive run seems to end into an outofmemoryerror or it fails when there is a native library to load several time this is far from being perfect but should work in most case,1
todo a warning line that show code which contains a variable error will cause some trouble the parser should definitely be much better,1
todo is this comment still relevant \? \? fixme need to use a saxsource a the source for the transform so we can plug in our own entity resolver,1
xxx i really do not like this the xml processor is still too 'involved in the processing a better solution imo would be to create ue for project and target too and then process the tree and have projecttarget deal with it attribute similar with description if we eventually switch to or add support for dom thing will work smoothly ue can be avoided almost completely it could still be created on demand for backward compatibility,1
junit wrap solo test this way we can extract the original test name with a little hack,1
xxx ignore attribute in a different n maybe store them \?,1
borrowed from tokenfiltertest,1
xxx move to project so it is shared by all helper,1
what is the property supposed to be \?,1
pr hack for ant type value an ant type is a component name which can be namespaced need to extract the name and convert from qualified name to uriname,1

todo not read yet in a public setter,1
pr i do not know what to do if the object class ha multiple defines but this is for logging only,1
not sure what could be the need of this,1
xxx jon skeet any reason for writing a message and then using a bare runtimeexception rather than just using a buildexception here \? is it in case the message could end up being written to no logger a the logger could have failed to be created due to this failure \?,1
experimentaltesting will be removed,1
xxx should instead make a new protectiondomain with a codesource corresponding to container touri tourl and the same permissioncollection a project class protectiondomain had,1
this is really irritating we need a way to set stuff,1
xxx all this to convert source to destination directory according to weblogic standard can be written better this is too hacky !,1
silly hack to avoid stack overflow,1
access to property table this is used to support ant call and similar task it should be deprecated it is possible to use a better more efficient mechanism to preserve the context,1
xxx should throw an exception instead \?,1
temporary until we figure a better api,1
there is a better way to save the context this should not delegate to next it 's for backward compatibility only,1
quick fix for ant java use of property before initializing the project,1
xxx we should use jcvs www ice comjcvs instead of command line execution so that we do not rely on having native cv stuff around sm,1
two reason are mentioned in the api doc for file list dir is not a directory this is impossible a we would not get here in this case an io error occurred why doe not it throw an exception then \? \? \?,1
jakarta common logging listener note do not use the simplelog a your logger implementation a it cause an infinite loop since it writes to system err which ant trap and reroutes to the loggerlistener layer the following name are used for the log org apache tool ant project project name for project event org apache tool ant target target name for target event task class name target name for event in individual target in all target and project name we replace and with todo we should use the advanced context logging feature and expose them in c l first todo this is very inefficient switching the out and tracking the log can be optimized a lot but may require few more change to the core since ant,1
todo using taskname here is brittle a a user could override it this should probably be modified to use the classname instead,1
these are pathological case but retained in case somebody subclassed u,1
this is a rather hairy case one of our subclass know that we need to update the archive but at the same time there are no resource known to u that would need to be added only the subclass seems to know what 's going on this happens if detects that the manifest ha changed for example the manifest is not part of any resource because of our support for inline s if we invoke createemptyzip like ant did we 'll loose all stuff that ha been in the original archive bugzilla report,1
this is deprecated use classespath in the future,1
xxx this array stuff is a remnant of prev trial got ta remove,1
set the number of millisecond leeway to give before deciding a target is out of date todo this is not yet used param granularity the granularity used to decide if a target is out of date,1
this may change if we add advanced parsing capability,1
we assume that every output jikes doe stand for an errorwarning xxx is this correct \?,1
the line below is a hack the system id must an uri but it is not cleat to get the uri of an resource so just set the name of the resource a a system id,1
xxx what is the following doing \? should it run if ! javadoc executable ! null \?,1
mac o and previous todo i have no idea how to get it someone must fix it,1
todo nothing appears to read this but is set using a public setter,1
xxx we are committing combiningchar and extender here,1
xxx failed to load the class properly should we print a warning here \?,1
xxx could perhaps also call thread stop not sure if anyone care,1
xxx perhaps we should not use property for these three option emacs mode warning and pedantic but include it in the javac directive \?,1
xxx maybe use reflection to addpathelement other pattern \?,1
todo there is a problem with the constructor for the rbc you have to provide the rule in the constructor no setter available,1
probably not the best choice but it solves the problem of relative path in classpath,1
fix for invalid character if you think of more add to the list,1
fallback in case we have trouble loading the class or do not know how to handle it there is no easy way to know what idl mode would generate this is supposed to make ant always recompile the class a a file of that name should not exist,1
check it out also ugly,1
i can not get my head around this is encoding treatment needed here \?,1
quick dirty to make nested mapped p set work,1
xxx is this code still necessary \? is there any port \? pull in zip from package directory,1
only the developer know what s he is doing,1
xxx unfortunately jdk add entryset keyset value implementing this requires a small hack we can add it later,1

super validateattributes do not want to call this method,1

we keep this so we have something to delete in later test,1
copied from concattest,1
not sure whether this is clean but this method is declared not to throw exception,1
we just set the prefix for this fileset and pas it up do we need to do this \? lh,1
why do we do nothing \?,1
we have to deal with assembly ! ! ! the programmer can be writing little byte chunk for all we know and we must assemble complete record for writing review maybe this should be in tarbuffer \? could that help to eliminate some of the buffer copying,1
this is the new better way use classespath instead of sourcespath the code is currently the same you need class file in a directory to use this or jar file,1
xxx why not simply new file dir filename \?,1
this is ugly checking for the root folder,1
todo parameterise \? \? call compiler a class dont want to fork again use classic compiler can be parameterised \?,1
xxx all this to get package according to weblogic standard can be written better this is too hacky ! careful similar code in scandir but slightly different ! !,1
stolen from writemanifest,1
if the jarfile already exists then whack it and recreate it should probably think of a more elegant way to handle this so that in case of error we do not leave people worse off than when we started,1
xxx is the following really necessary \? it is in the same thread group,1
we have to find a cleaner way to put this output,1
this is the old way and is deprecated classespath is the right way to do this and is above,1
for script example that modifies id'ed task in other target to work very ugly the reference is replaced by runtimeconfigurable,1
do not call super close because that reader is used on other place,1
report error if something weird happens this is diagnostic,1
sorry otherwise we will get a classcastexception because the mockcache is loaded by two different classloader,1
hack we ask the vm to create an instance by voluntarily providing illegal argument to force the vm to run the class static initializer while at the same time not running a valid constructor,1

an output stream that compress into the bzip format without the file header char into another stream the compression requires large amount of memory thus you should call the link close close method a soon a possible to force cbzip outputstream to release the allocated memory you can shrink the amount of allocated memory and maybe raise the compression speed by choosing a lower blocksize which in turn may cause a lower compression ratio you can avoid unnecessary memory allocation by avoiding using a blocksize which is bigger than the size of the input you can compute the memory usage for compressing by the following formula k blocksize to get the memory required for decompression by link cbzip inputstream cbzip inputstream use k blocksize memory usage by blocksize blocksize compressionmemory usage decompressionmemory usage k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k for decompression cbzip inputstream allocates le memory if the bzipped input is smaller than one block instance of this class are not threadsafe todo update to bzip,1

where oh where ha my test case gone \?,1
attribute name and value while the xml spec doe not require preserving the order afaik some ant test do rely on the exact order the following code is copied from attributeimpl we could also just use sax attribute and convert to sax dom attribute node can also be stored in sax attribute xxx under jdk you can just use a linkedhashmap for this purpose jglick the only exception to this order is the treatment of refid a number of datatypes check if refid is set when other attribute are set this check will not work if the build script ha the other attribute before the refid attribute so now ant the refid attribute will be processed first,1

also check for properly formed uris ant formerly recommended using nonsense uris such a file foo xml in xml includes you should not do that just foo xml is correct but for compatibility we special case thing when the path is not absolute and fall back to the old parsing behavior,0

if the archive is built for the first time and it is matched by a resource collection then it ha not been found in check it ha not been there but will be included now for some strange reason the old code would simply skip the entry and not fail do the same now for backwards compatibility reason without this the which j build fails in gump,0
we only like simple mapper,0

preserveintarget would find all file we want to keep but we need to find all that we want to delete so the meaning of all pattern and selector must be inverted,0
the zero index is never present in the constant pool itself so we add a null entry for it,0
if the destination directory did not already exist or wa empty then no previous file removal is necessary !,0
start at because element is the executable name,0
default the viewpath to basedir if it is not specified,0

set up a vsshistory task,0
at this point there is one trailing space to remove if the list is not empty,0
restore the lastmodified attribute,0
do nothing if no resource including nested text,0
we normally compare destination with source,0
filesets ha been protected so we need to keep that even after switching to resource collection in fact they will still get a different treatment form the other resource collection even in execute since we have some subtle special feature like switching type to dir when we encounter a dirset that would be more difficult to achieve otherwise,0

for historical and performance reason we have to do thing in a rather complex way move is optimized to move directory if a fileset ha been included completely therefore filesets need a special treatment this is also required to support the failonerror semantice skip filesets with broken basedir but handle the remaining collection we carry around a few protected method that work on basedirs and array of name to optimize stuff all resource with the same basedir get collected in separate list and then each list is handled in one go,0

this comment wa included in a previous version before of the test which had this assertion commented out interaction should not be removed when removing classifierrole maybe if the last message is removed from the interaction but even then it 's doubtfull since it will probably lead to backward compatibility problem in save format but my reading of the uml specification is that an interaction without at least one message is definitely illegal so mdr is doing the right thing by removing it in this case where we only have a single message which then get deleted tfm,0

todo deal with the optional attribute in the mapping this code assumes that optional default to true because it doe not actually seem to work in the fetch join code note that actual proper handling of optional ality here is actually more involved than this patch assumes remember that we might have multiple mapping associated with a single entity really a couple of thing need to happen to properly handle optional here first and foremost when handling multiple s we really should be using the entity root table a the driving table another option here would be to choose some non optional joined table to use a the driving table in all likelihood just using the root table is much simplier need to add the fk column corresponding to each joined table to the generated select list these would then be used when iterating the result set to determine whether all non optional data is present my initial thought on the best way to deal with this would be to introduce a new sequentialselect abstraction that actually get generated in the persisters ok singletable and utilized here it would encapsulated all this required optional ality checking,1

three general case we check here a to whether to render a physical sql join is our parent a dotnode a well \? if so our property reference is being further de referenced is this a dml statement we were asked to generate any needed join generatejoinstrue or we are currently processing a select or from clause an additional check is the regression style join suppression check solely intended for the test suite the regression style join suppression is an additional check intended solely for use within the test suite this force the implicit join resolution to behave more like the classic parser the underlying issue is that classic translator is simply wrong about it decision on whether or not to render an implicit join into a physical sql join in a lot of case the piece it generally tends to miss is that inner join effect the result by further restricting the data set ! a particular manifestation of this is the fact that the classic translator will skip the physical join for toone implicit join if the query is shallow the result being that query list and query iterate could return different number of result !,1

orphan should not be deleted during copy \? \?,1
orphan should not be deleted during merge \? \?,1
todo suck this logic into the collection !,1
todo we can actually just determine this from the incoming entityentry s,1
todo this bit actually ha to be called after all cascade ! but since identity insert is called synchronously instead of asynchronously a other action it is not,1
this class ha no proxy so do a shortcut,1
todo should this be an initializeentityeventlistener \? \? \? watch out for performance !,1
todo need map \? the prob is a proper key right \?,1
todo better to pas the id in a an argument \?,1
do we even really need this \? the update will fail anyway,1
todo would it be better to do a refresh from db \?,1
this form used from annotation \? essentially the same a the above using a resultset mapping reference but without cachemode readonly and comment fixme annotation do not use it so it can be remove from my pov deprecated param query the sql query string param resultsetref the result set mapping name param queryspaces any specified query space used for auto flushing param cacheable whether the query result are cacheable param cacheregion if cacheable the region into which to store the result param timeout a jdbc level timeout to be applied param fetchsize a jdbc level fetch size to be applied param flushmode the flush mode to use for this query param parametertypes parameter type map param callable doe the query string represent a callable object i e proc,1
todo ugly here,1
todo not quite sure about the full implication of this !,1
this only work because collection entry are kept in a sequenced map by persistence context maybe we should do like entity and keep a separate sequence set todo calling entryset on an identitymap is slow ! !,1
todo i 'd much rather have this done from endloadingcollection collectionpersister loadingcollectionentry,1
todo hack ! ! ! note here we cleanup the load context when we have no more local lce entry this work for the time being because really only the collection load context are implemented long term this cleanup should become part of the close result set processing from the sandboxjdbc jdbc container code,1
todo add the notion of enabled filter to the cachekey to differentiate filtered collection from non filtered but cachekey is currently used for both collection and entity would ideally need to define two seperate one currently this work in conjuction with the check on defaultinitializecollectioneventhandler initializecollectionfromcache which make sure to not read from cache with enabled filter early exit ! ! ! ! !,1
postload is needed for ejb todo reuse the postloadevent,1
todo should we check the current isolation mode explicitly \?,1
brand new collection todo or an array ! ! we can not lock object with array now \? \?,1
todo iteratively get transient entity and retry merge until one of the following condition transientcopycache size transientcopycache size is not decreasing and copycache size is not increasing todo find out if retrying can add entity to copycache do not think it can for now just retry once throw transientobjectexception if there are still any transient entity,1
null or brand new collection this will also inefficiently handle array which have no snapshot so we can not do any better,1
todo perhaps we should additionally require that the incoming entity version be equivalent to the defined unsaved value \?,1
provides query splitting method which were originally in querytranslator todo this will need to be refactored at some point author josh,1
todo most of below wa taken verbatim from dotnode should either delegate this logic or super type it,1
todo currently expects that the individual with expression apply to the same sql table join this may not be the case for joined subclass where the property value might be coming from different table in the joined hierarchy at some point we should expand this to support that capability however that ha some difficulty the biggest is how to handle or when the individual comparison are linked to different sql join here we would need to track each comparison individually along with the join alias to which it applies and then pas that information back to the fromelement so it can pas it along to the joinsequence,1
no explicit select expression render the id and property projection list for every persister in the from clause into a single 'token node todo the only reason we need this stuff now is collection filter we should get rid of derived select clause completely !,1
todo better way \? ! \?,1
hack alert ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! attempt to work around ghost impliedfromelements that occasionally show up between the actual thing being joined this consistently occurs from index node at least against many to many not sure if there are other condition essentially look ahead to the next fromelement that actually writes something to the sql,1
not possible to simply re use the versionpropertynode here a it cause oom error due to circularity,1
this function ha a template restore output apply the template and write the result out todo downcast to avoid using an interface \? yuck,1
at some point the generate phase need to be moved out of here because a single object level dml might spawn multiple sql dml command execution possible to just move the sql generation for dml stuff but for consistency sake probably best to just move responsiblity for the generation phase completely into the delegate queryloaderstatementexecutor themselves also not sure why queryloader currently even ha a dependency on this at all doe it need it \? ideally like to see the walker itself given to the delegate directly,1
todo this is only needed during compilation can we eliminate the instvar \?,1
todo absolutely no usage of this constructor form can it go away \?,1
todo is this a bit ugly \?,1
even here if only property mapped to the base table are referenced in the set and where clause this could be handled by the basicdelegate todo decide if it is better performance wise to perform that check or to simply use the multitableupdatedelegate,1
todo remove these last two a batcher is no longer managing connection,1
very important ! ! ! ! this class need to be free of any static reference to any cglib or javassist class otherwise user will always need both on their classpaths no matter which if either they use another option here would be to remove the hibernate ispropertyinitialized method and have the user go through the sessionfactory to get this information,1
todo we really need to be able to deal with component path here also this is difficult because the hql sql grammar expects all those node type to be fromreferencenodes one potential fix here would be to convert the intoclause to just use a fromclausefromelement combo a a child of the insertstatement and move all this logic into the insertstatement that 's probably the easiest approach read least amount of change to the grammar and code but just doe not feel right a then an insert would contain from clause,1
todo an optimization here would be to consider cascade deletes and not gen those delete statement the difficulty is the ordering of the table here v the cascade attribute on the persisters the table info gotten here should really be self contained i e a class representation defining all the needed attribute then we could then get an array of those,1
todo switch statement are always evil ! we already had bug because of forgotten token type use polymorphism for this !,1
really there are two situation where it should be ok to allow the insertion into property defined on a superclass union subclass with an abstract root entity discrim subclass is handled already because of the fact that unionsubclasspersister alreay always return for this call we may want to disallow it for discrim subclass just for consistency sake currently doe not work anyway,1
implicit join are always \? ok to reuse,1
todo used to be exprnoparens ! wa this needed \?,1
todo we may also want to check that the type here map to exactly one columnjdbc type can not think of a situation where arithmetic expression between multi column mapping make any sense,1
we do not know either type blind guess !,1
todo get sql rendering out of here create an ast for the join expression use the sql generator grammar to generate the sql text for the index expression,1
we would probably refactor to have logicparser build a tree of simple expression connected by and or not expressionparser translates from oo term like foo foo bar foo bar baz to sql term like foos id foos bar id etc and pathexpressionparser which doe much the same thing it doe now,1
short circuit for performance,1
not absolutely necessary but doe help with aggressive release,1
try block is a hack around fact that currently tuplizers are not given the opportunity to resolve a subclass entity name this allows the we assume custom interceptor the ability to influence this decision if we were not able to based on the given entityname,1
todo this is one of the ugliest and most fragile piece of code in hibernate,1
todo implement functionality this might be painful to do here a the join post processing for the subquery ha already been performed meaning that for theta join dialect the join condition have already been moved over to the where clause a simple solution here might to perform join post processing once for the entire query including any subqueries at one fell swoop,1
yuck !,1
ignore it the incoming property could not be found so we can not be sure what to do here at the very least the safest is to simply not apply any dereference toggling,1
todo make this a bit nicer,1
yuck !,1
todo potentially look at optimizing these two array,1
note that i parameter is now unused delete it \?,1
todo figure out a better way to get the from element in a proper tree structure if this is not the destination of a many to many add it a a child of the origin,1
todo this constructor form is only used from constructor directly below u can it go away \?,1
todo remove,1
we should reengineer this class so that rather than the current ad hoc linear approach to processing a stream of token we instead build up a tree of expression,1
todo should this get moved to persistentcontext \? logically is persistentcontext the thing to which an interceptor get attached \?,1
todo something much better look at the type of the other expression ! todo have comparisonexpression andor arithmeticexpression rule complete the resolution of boolean node,1
todo this class doe too many thing ! we need a different kind of path expression parser for each of the diffferent way in which path expression can occur,1
todo optimize this better !,1
todo should we allow suffix on these \?,1
todo is this really necessary \? \? \? \?,1
todo not sure the best way to handle this the non performant way,1
todo is there a better way \?,1
the class is now way to complex !,1
todo would be really nice to cache the spec on the query def so a to not have to re calc the hash currently not doable though because of the resultset ref stuff,1
name from a super query a bit inelegant that it show up here,1
real hacky used to count the nesting of parenthesis,1
todo we can remove this once the deprecated ctor can be made private,1
put ha nowait semantics is this really appropriate \? note that it need to be async replication never local or sync,1
ugly hack for case like element foo bar collection multi part path expression ending in element or index,1
fixme hacky workaround to jbcache,1
todo copypaste from sessionimpl pull up !,1
todo need to find a clean way to handle the event source role a seperate class responsible for generatingdispatching event just duplicate most of the session method passing around seperate reto interceptor factory actionqueue and persistentcontext is not manageable,1
must be done here because of side effect ! yuck,1
we should actually rework this class to not implement parser and just process path expression in the most convenient way,1
todo should remove this exposure and have all reference to the session 's batcher use the connectionmanager,1
we may be screwed here since the collection action is about to execute and we do not know the final owner key value,1
needed the clazz check to work around union subclass todo is there a way to tell whether a persister is truly discrim column based inheritence \?,1

workaround for weblogic,1
todo temporary,1
todo yuck ! ! ! fix after hhh is complete,1
would be great to move all this below here into another method that could also be used from the new scrolling stuff would need to change the way the max row stuff is handled i e behind an interface so that i could do the control breaking at the mean to know when to stop,1
todo the ientityspan bit depends upon subclass implementation very bad,1
some messy complex stuff here since createcriteria can take an aliased path or a path rooted at the creating criterion instance,1
todo add a criteriaimplementor interface this class depends directly upon criteriaimpl in the impl package,1
polymorphism not really handled completely correctly perhaps well actually it ok assuming that the entity name used in the lookup is the same a the the one used here which it will be,1
this is not very nice and quite slow,1
todo get sql rendering out of here,1
meant to handle dynamic instantiation query copy from queryloader,1

todo this eventually need to be removed,1
todo design new lifecycle for proxyfactory,1
todo we should really just collect these from the various selectexpressions rather than regenerating here,1
todo should this really return null \? if not figure out something better to do here,1
todo should seriously consider not allowing a txn to begin from a child session can always route the request to the root session,1
should indicate that we are processing an insertupdatedelete query with a subquery implied via a collection property function here we need to use the table name itself a the qualification alias todo verify this work for all database todo is this also the case in non indexed scenario \?,1
todo this really need to be delayed unitl after we definitively know all node type where this is currently a problem is parameter for which where we can not unequivocally resolve an expected type,1
todo make this the factory for entity mode related session also mean making this the target of transaction synch and the thing that know how to cascade thing between related session at that point perhaps this thing is a sessioncontext and connectionmanager is a jdbccontext \? a sessioncontext should live in the impl package,1
create an index on the key column \? \?,1
is this ok \?,1
init the table here instead of earlier so that we can get a quoted table name todo would it be better to simply pas the qualified table name instead of splitting it up into schemacatalogtable name,1
perhaps this should be an exception since it is only ever used in the above method \?,1
note this assumes something about how propertyselectfragment is implemented by the subclass ! wa tounqotedaliasstrings getdiscriminatorcolumnname before now tried to remove that unqoting and missing alias,1
put a placeholder in entry so we do not recurse back and try to save the same object again question should this be done before onsave is called \? likewise should it be done before onupdate \?,1
before cascade ! todo should this be session instantiate persister \?,1
todo we should throw an exception if we really know for sure that this is a detached instance rather than just assuming throw new staleobjectstateexception entityname id,1
todo the order in which entity are saved may matter e g a particular transient entity may need to be saved before other transient entity can be saved keep retrying the batch of transient entity until either there are no transient entity left in transientcopycache or no transient entity were saved in the last batch for now just run through the transient entity and retry the merge,1
todo if object wa an uninitialized proxy this is inefficient resulting in two sql selects,1
todo put this stuff back in to read snapshot from the second level cache need some extra work,1
todo not quite sure about the full implication of this !,1
this is kinda the best we can do,1

it is possible that the tree walking in outerjoinloader can get to an association defined by a subclass in which case the property ref might refer to a property defined on a subclass of the current class in this case the table name is not known this temporary solution assumes that the property ref refers to a property of the subclass table that the association belongs to a reasonable guess todo fix this add outerjoinloadable getsubclasspropertytablename string propertyname,1

this is a sloppy hack to fix bug hitting return after collapsed fold the idea is that if we extend the range then the problem described in the bug happends so if the insert is at the very end of the range we do not extend it instead we push the insert into the next range however for this to work properly we also have to mess with screen line count,1

first try for an accessible version of the exact match this first lookup seems redundant with below but is apparently needed this whole thing is messy,1
work around for broken ftp plugin !,1
hack to move the space to the front,1
this feel sloppy especially for non u s locale,1
hack to get fixed length 'length field,1
we have to deal with assembly ! ! ! the programmer can be writing little byte chunk for all we know and we must assemble complete record for writing review maybe this should be in tarbuffer \? could that help to eliminate some of the buffer copying,1
hack done to fix bringing the window to the front at least on window frame tofront doe not cut it remove the iswindows check if it 's broken under other os too,1
this method should be rewritten to use getfields and avoid catching exception during the search,1
hack,1
this is such a bad way of doing it but oh well,1
xxx magic number,1
this should probably be in reflect java,1
note see note on findmostspecificmethod this method should be rolled into findmostspecificmethod,1
note is using signaturekey in this way dangerous \? in the pathological case a user could eat up memory caching every possible combination of argument type to an untyped method maybe we could be smarter about it by ignoring the type of untyped parameter position \? the method resolver could return a set of hint for the signature key caching \? there is also the overhead of creating one of these for every method dispatched what is the alternative \?,1
crusty workaround,1
workaround for a key producing garbage on window,1
addtofavorites which is a static method for convinience need an instance of the vfs to pas to vfsmanager sendvfsupdate hence this hack,1
allow getthis to work through blocknamespace to the method namespace xxx re eval this do we need it \?,1
this part suck,1
these are used to eliminate code duplication i do not normally use the visitor or template method pattern but this code wa contributed by peter cox and i do not feel like changing it around too much,1
switch eats a multi level break here \? not empty statement,1
this part suck,1
fuck me dead,1
stupid hack to handle referencing a rule set that is defined later !,1
jdk workaround,1
fuck me dead,1
should the next two be public maybe \?,1
stupidity,1
note this method and resolveexpectedjavafield should be rewritten to invert this logic so that no exception need to be caught unecessarily this is just a temporary impl return the field or null if not found,1
note we need a singleton here so that thing like 'this this work and probably a good idea for speed caching a single instance here seems technically incorrect considering the declaringinterpreter could be different under some circumstance case a child interpreter running a source eval command however the effect is just that the main interpreter that executes your script should be the one involved in call back from java i do not know if there are corner case where a child interpreter would be the first to use a this reference in a namespace or if that would even cause any problem if it did we could do some experiment to find out and if necessary we could cache on a per interpreter basis if we had weak reference we might also look at skipping over child interpreter and going to the parent for the declaring interpreter so we 'd be sure to get the top interpreter,1
resolve relative to a class type static field inner class \?,1
some regexps eg by itself have a length so we implement this hack if you do not understand what 's going on here then go back to watching mtv,1
optimization if classofstaticmethod is set then we have already been here and determined that this is a static method invocation note maybe factor this out with path below clean up,1
this will probably not get used object type,1
window jdk workaround,1
this listener priority thing is a bad hack,1
this doe not look pretty and mode line should probably be split up into seperate componentsstrings,1
this is stupid and misleading but 'path is not used anywhere except the above line and if this is done after the 'continue then we will either hang or be forced to duplicate it inside the buffer null or add a 'finally clause you decide which one 's worse,1
workaround for hang if match wa zero width not sure if there is a better way to handle this,1
xxx magic number,1
on window path of the form x list the last working directory on that drive to list the root of the drive you must use x however the vfs browser and friend strip off trailing path separator for various reason so to work around that we add a to drive letter path on window,1
on unix set permission of port file to rw so that on broken unices which give everyone read access to user home dirs people can not see your port file and hence send arbitriary beanshell code your way nasty,1
\? \? \? this should only be called with fully loaded action set,1
broken eclipse workaround ! febuary,1
note this is broken it find public but le specific method over non public but more specific one this method need to be rewritten to eliminate findaccessiblemethod we should implement the findmostspecificmethod that us the publiconly flag findmostspecificmethod should also operate in two pass to give standard java assignable match priority over extended bsh type match,1
xxx this should not be hardcoded,1
interval operator x x x y re interval re no bk brace x x x y re interval ! re no bk brace open question what is proper interpretation of at start of string \?,1
xxx doe this really belong here \?,1
we do need to save every possible point but the number of clone invocation here is really a killer for performance on non stingy repeat operator i 'm open to suggestion,1
note this should really just throw nosuchfieldexception need to change related signature and code,1

st step a explained above resizing an instruction may require to resize another one which may require to resize yet another one and so on the first step of the algorithm consists in finding all the instruction that need to be resized without modifying the code this is done by the following fix point algorithm parse the code to find the jump instruction whose offset will need more than byte to be stored the future offset is computed from the current offset and from the number of byte that will be inserted or removed between the source and target instruction for each such instruction add an entry in a copy of the index and size array if this ha not already been done in a previous iteration ! if at least one entry ha been added during the previous step go back to the beginning otherwise stop in fact the real algorithm is complicated by the fact that the size of tableswitch and lookupswitch instruction depends on their position in the bytecode because of padding in order to ensure the convergence of the algorithm the number of byte to be added or removed from these instruction is over estimated during the previous loop and computed exactly only after the loop is finished this requires another pas to parse the bytecode of the method,0

fixme this whole thing could probably be implemented a a module and mixed into appropriate class especially if it us either ioinputoutputstream or is smart about the kind of io like object it 's being used against,1
fixme bit of a kludge here non interface class assigned to both class and module field simplifies proxy extender code will go away when ji is overhauled and proxy extenders are deprecated,1
fixme what should these really be \? numeric \? assert x instanceof rubycomplex y instanceof rubycomplex,1
we 're depending on the side effect of the load which load the class but doe not turn it into a script i do not like it but until we restructure the code a bit more we 'll need to quietly let it by here,1
fixme we should also support orgs that use capitalized package name including embarrassingly the one i work for but this should be enabled by a system property a the expected default behavior for an upper case value should be and is to treat it a a class name and raise an exception if it 's not found,1
index for the item this could probably be more efficient bailing out on assigning args past the end \?,1
todo this version differs from ioctl by checking whether fcntl exists and raising notimplemented if it doe not perhaps no difference for u \?,1

this need to be split since conditional calling inherited doe not fit standard ruby semantics,1
xxx again screwy evaling under previous frame 's scope,1
ss fixme maybe this is not really a concern after all nesting level of this scope in the lexical nesting of scope in the current file this is not to be confused with semantic nesting of scope across file consider this code in a file f class m m m c end so c is at lexical nesting level of the file script is at in the file f semantically it is at level m m m are at this is primarily used to ensure that variable name do not clash ! i e definition of v in a closure should not override the use of v from the parent scope ! private int lexicalnestinglevel,1

for oracle g we could say something like where xmlserialize content coldef getlabel like `` this doe not appear to work on oracle i at the moment so we will avoid using this column in any where clause if the value is non null which is what the superclass implementation doe todo find a way to do this for both version or split this behavior so that it work on g and is disabled on i,0

to allow the fw to save and reload user option related to specific column we construct a unique name for the table so the column can be associcated with only that table some driver do not provide the catalog or schema info so those part of the name will end up a null that 's ok since this string is never viewed by the user and is just used to distinguish this table from other table in the db we also include the url used to connect to the db so that the same tabledb on different machine is treated differently,0
